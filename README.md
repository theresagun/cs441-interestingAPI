I created an app using augmented reality so you can create your own butterfly garden. When you open the app, you can see your surroundings through your camera and there is a menu at the bottom. The menu lets you choose between viewing flowers or butterflies. You can choose an object from the menu and tap to place it in the world. After placing the object, you can move it around to design your garden.

Known flaw: The purple flower and the rose are the incorrect scale. My computer crashed whenever I tried to edit those images so I left them large.
